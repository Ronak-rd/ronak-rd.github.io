BRIEF:-

Hello and thanks for reading my READ ME file. 
I have created my portfolio using mordern frame work Bootstrap. I have also used my own custom CSS. I have tried to demostrate all of my own skills that I have Learnt in Responsive Web Design-1&2. 
I was trying to have a different kind of banner which can occupy all available width of any device, which I have sucessfully got. This is juust to demonstrate that I am having knowledge about VH and VW. I have used mordern frame work to demostrate my bootstrap skills and In many locations I have also overrided by using my own custom CSS.

CHALLENGES:-
I had problems in my starting phase only after that No major problems were seen. There were some issues but they were minor. The major ones are listed below:

When I was trying to achive my goal (full width for device). I had to go through alot of troubles like the viewport was not matching up and all. I did bit of a research and I finally have it.
Other problem was that I have put a different color of layer on my banner image just to give it a different shade and I have manually adjusted everything like putting Text on the image above that color layer, putting navigation on upper right of banner and putting logo over the banner and color layer on the upper right. I had go through alot of problems with balancing everything because my thing keep moving here and there all over my web page. When I fix one thing, I realize that I messed some other things but I finally adjusted everthing using commands like Flex, top, right, left and the most Important "Z-index".  

After sucessfully getting thing just as I wanted. The other major issue that I came across is MY CONTENT GOT MISSING because of my "Z-index". I came to know that My all content is just going under my banner. To solve this problem I gave Min_height in my div of about 100vh and the problem was solved.

After this all thing, No major issues were found and I sucessfully finished up my last assignment of Responsive Web Design.

Things I learnt: 

The most Important thing that I have learnt is using View port height and width. I have learnt that in our classroom but that was a bit confusing and I was not able to get at that time. But when I tried my self I understand the concept and learnt that. 

I was always looking to learn about that color changing social media icons. Which changes there color on hover respectively to thier original color, I found on google and learnt using them in my webpage through FONT AWESOME ICONS.

I learnt to see the code from inspect tool for bootstrap and override the major important code.

I also learnt using !important rule. I really find it very amusing because we can override any thing easily by using !important rule.
